# Dynamic Island Generator üèùÔ∏è

## Author: Sreeram Kondapalli

## Description

This project, Dynamic Island Generator, aims to simulate the dynamic creation of islands through randomized particle drops. By utilizing dynamic arrays and applying various algorithms, it generates an island landscape based on user inputs such as grid size, drop-zone coordinates, number of particles, and more. The islands are represented in different stages - raw, normalized, and a polished final version, all visualized through colorful terminal outputs and saved into text files.
